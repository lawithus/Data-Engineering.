🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. Clone & Start
git clone https://github.com/lawithus/Data-Engineering..git

2. Setup Databases
psql -U postgres -f storage/postgres_setup.sql
mongo < storage/mongodb_setup.js

3. Run Kafka Producer
python ingestion/kafka_producer.py

4. Launch Spark Risk Job
spark-submit processing/spark_jobs/credit_scoring_job.py

⚙️ Components and Scripts

    Kafka Producer (Python) Simulates loan applications and streams to Kafka.

ingestion/kafka_producer.py python from kafka import KafkaProducer import json, time, random

producer = KafkaProducer( bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8') )

def generate_event(): return { "application_id": random.randint(1000, 9999), "user_id": random.randint(1, 100), "credit_score": random.randint(300, 850), "loan_amount": round(random.uniform(1000, 20000), 2), "timestamp": time.time() }

while True: data = generate_event() producer.send('credit_applications', value=data) print("Sent:", data) time.sleep(2)

    Flink Job (Pseudo) Detects fraud in real time.

Logic:

    If loan_amount > 15000 and credit_score < 450 → alert
    Result stored in MongoDB.

flink_jobs/fraud_detection.py python Pseudo-PyFlink if loan_amount > 15000 and credit_score < 450: emit_alert(application_id, reason="Risky transaction")

    Spark Job Calculates risk scores from Kafka or HDFS and writes to PostgreSQL.

processing/spark_jobs/credit_scoring_job.py python from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import when

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CreditScoring").getOrCreate()

df = spark.read.json("hdfs://localhost:9000/kafka-data/credit_apps.json")

df = df.withColumn("risk_level", when(df.credit_score >= 700, "Low") .when(df.credit_score >= 500, "Medium" .otherwise("High"))

df.write.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/creditdb")
.option("dbtable", "credit_scores")
.option("user", "postgres")
.option("password", "admin")
.mode("append").save()

    PostgreSQL Setup

storage/postgres_setup.sql sql CREATE TABLE credit_scores ( application_id INT, user_id INT, credit_score INT, loan_amount FLOAT, risk_level TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

CREATE TABLE data_quality_issues ( record_id SERIAL, issue TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

CREATE TABLE metadata_table ( job TEXT, source TEXT, target TEXT,

    Access Control: DB roles and service authentication
    Lineage: Metadata tracked in metadata_table
    Policies:
        Credit score ≥ 600 for low risk
        Loan amount ≤ $15,000 for instant approval
    Auditing: Logged via Kafka + Spark job logs


🧪 Generating Dummy Data

We'll use Python's Faker library to generate realistic dummy transaction data.

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

bash
pip install faker pandas


2. Generate Dummy Data

Create a script named generate_dummy_data.py inside the data/ directory:

```python
from faker import Faker
import pandas as pd
import uuid
import random

fake = Faker()
transactions = []

for _ in range(1000):
    transaction = {
        "transaction_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
"user_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "amount": round(random.uniform(10, 5000), 2),
        "timestamp": fake.iso8601(),
        "location": fake.city(),
        "merchant": fake.company(),
        "card_type": random.choice(["VISA", "MASTERCARD", "AMEX"]),
        "device_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "credit_score": random.randint(300, 850),
        "risk_level": random.choice(["Low", "Medium", "High"]),
        "is_fraud": random.choice([True, False])
    }
    transactions.append(transaction)

df = pd.DataFrame(transactions)
df.to_csv("transactions.csv", index=False)


Run the script to generate the `transactions.csv` file:

bash
python data/generate_dummy_data.py


---

⚙️ Setting Up the Environment

We'll use Docker Compose to set up the necessary services.

1. Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    depends_on: [zookeeper]
    ports: ["9092:9092"]
    environment:
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

  mongo:
image: mongo
    ports: ["27017:27017"]

  postgres:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: credit
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpass
    ports: ["5432:5432"]

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports: ["3000:3000"]


Start the services:

bash
docker-compose up -d


---

🚀 Running the Kafka Producer

The Kafka producer will read the dummy data and send it to the Kafka topic.

1. Kafka Producer Script

Create a script named `producer.py` inside the `src/kafka_producer/` directory:

python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
import pandas as pd
import time

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda m: json.dumps(m).encode('utf-8')
)

df = pd.read_csv('data/transactions.csv')
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    message = row.to_dict()
    producer.send("transactions", message)
    print("Sent:", message)
    time.sleep(1)


Run the producer:

bash
python src/kafka_producer/producer.py
```

---

🔄 Apache Flink Job

The Flink job will process the data from Kafka, perform transformations, and detect fraud.

Note: Implement the Flink job in Java or Scala using the DataStream API. Due to the complexity, the full implementation is beyond this summary.

🗄️ Data Storage

Processed data will be stored in MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

1. MongoDB Sink

Implement the MongoDB sink to store raw transactions.

2. PostgreSQL Sink

Implement the PostgreSQL sink to store processed transactions.

Ensure the PostgreSQL database has the necessary table:

sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS processed_transactions (
    transaction_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    amount NUMERIC,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    location TEXT,
    merchant TEXT,
    card_type TEXT,

Add governance and Quality control to this project
Here’s how you can integrate Data Governance and Quality Control into your credit scoring, lending, and fraud detection project — directly in your architecture and pipeline:

---

✅ Data Governance Components

1. Access Control
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
   - Secure services in docker-compose.yml with network isolation and environment secrets.
   - Configure Grafana/Prometheus login with secure credentials.

2. Audit Logging
   - Enable PostgreSQL query logging for insert/update/delete tracking.
   - Log all Kafka events to a separate credit_applications_log topic (for replay/debug).

3. Data Lineage
   - Use metadata tagging in Spark jobs to label:
     - Source (Kafka)
     - Transformations (risk scoring/fraud logic)
  …
assert 300 <= data["credit_score"] <= 850
     
   - Use Avro/JSON schema enforcement via Kafka Schema Registry (optional).

2. *Missing or Invalid Data Handling*
   - Spark jobs:
     - Drop records with missing key fields
     - Flag questionable entries (e.g., `loan_amount = 0`) in a `data_quality_issues` table

3. *Monitoring Metrics*
   - Prometheus monitors:
     - Number of records processed
     - Invalid records dropped
     - Fraud alerts generated
   - Grafana dashboard panel: *“Data Quality Events”*

4. *Alerts*
   - Set up alerts in Grafana:
     - High fraud spike
     - Drop in Kafka message count
     - Data validation errors over threshold

---

include this to the whole project document
Here’s the updated section to include in your full project documentation under the headings Data Governance and Data Quality Control.

---

🛡️ Data Governance

This platform ensures secure, traceable, and policy-compliant handling of credit application data.

1. Access Control
- PostgreSQL & MongoDB secured via user roles and passwords.
- Grafana & Prometheus protected with admin credentials (admin/admin, change in production).
- Docker Network Isolation restricts external access to services.
- Use .env for secrets and sensitive configs.

2. Audit Logging
- Enable PostgreSQL logging for CRUD operations.
- Kafka messages optionally duplicated to credit_applications_log topic for replay and audit.
- Spark/Flink logs maintained in job history servers or local logs.

3. Dat…
- Power BI dashboard shows exceptions by customer or region.

---

✅ Data Quality Control

Ensures the pipeline delivers accurate, complete, and clean data at all times.

1. Validation Rules on Ingestion
- Kafka producer validates:
  python
  assert 300 <= data["credit_score"] <= 850
  assert data["loan_amount"] > 0
  
- Optionally use Avro schema with Confluent Schema Registry.

2. Spark Job Checks
- Detect and flag invalid or missing fields.
- Write to data_quality_issues table:
  sql
  CREATE TABLE data_quality_issues (
    record_id INT,
    issue TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
  );
  

3. Monitoring & Alerts
- Prometheus tracks:
  - Kafka topic lag
  - Dropped/invalid records
  - Number of fraud alerts
- Grafana dashboard shows:
  - “Data Quality Events”
  - Anomalie…

- Validation at Ingestion (e.g., credit score range, nulls)
- Spark Cleansing: Invalid records → data_quality_issues table
- Metrics: Dropped records, fraud rates, Kafka lags
- Alerts: Triggered via Grafana thresholds


Here’s a breakdown of the core scripts, what each one does, and the main code structure for the project:

1. kafka_producer.py  
Location: ingestion/  
Purpose: Simulates loan applications and sends them to Kafka.

python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json, time, random

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

def generate_event():
    return {
        "application_id": random.randint(1000, 9999),
        "user_id": random.randint(1, 100),
        "credit_score": random.randint(300, 850),
        "loan_amount": round(random.uniform(1000, 20000), 2),
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }

while True:
    data = generate_event()
    producer.send('credit_applications', value=data)
    print("Sent:", data)
    time.sleep(2)


✅ What it does: Sends a fake loan application every 2 seconds.

2. credit_scoring_job.py  
Location: processing/spark_jobs/  
Purpose: Calculates risk score and saves to PostgreSQL.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import when

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CreditScoring").getOrCreate()

df = spark.read.json("hdfs://localhost:9000/kafka-data/credit_apps.json")
df = df.withColumn("risk_level", when(df.credit_score >= 700, "Low")
                                 .when(df.credit_score >= 500, "Medium")
                                 .otherwise("High"))

df.write.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/creditdb")\
    .option("dbtable", "credit_scores")\
    .option("user", "postgres")\
    .option("password", "admin")\
    .mode("append").save()


✅ What it does: Reads JSON from HDFS, assigns risk level, and stores in PostgreSQL.



3. fraud_detection_flink.py`* *(pseudo-Flink job) 
*Location:* `processing/flink_jobs/`  
*Purpose:* Detects fraudulent behavior in real-time.

python
Pseudo-code for Flink job (actual requires Java/Scala or PyFlink setup)

if loan_amount > 15000 and credit_scor…
timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


✅ What it does: Creates the main risk scoring and quality logs tables.

5. *`mongodb_setup.js`*  
*Location:* `storage/`  
*Purpose:* Sets up MongoDB fraud alerts collection.

js
db.createCollection("fraud_alerts")
db.fraud_alerts.createIndex({ application_id: 1 })


✅ What it does: Prepares MongoDB to store fraud alerts.

---

6. `prometheus.yml  
*Location:* `monitoring/`  
*Purpose:* Prometheus configuration file to scrape services.

yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spark_jobs'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:4040']

  - job_name: 'kafka'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9308']

✅ What it does: Monitors Spark and Kafka metrics.

⚙️ Components and Scripts

1. *Kafka Producer (Python)*
Simulates loan applications and streams to Kafka.

*`ingestion/kafka_producer.py`*
python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json, time, random

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

def generate_event():
    return {
        "application_id": random.randint(1000, 9999),
        "user_id": random.randint(1, 100),
        "credit_score": random.randint(300, 850),
        "loan_amount": round(random.uniform(1000, 20000), 2),
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }

while True:
    data = generate_event()
    producer.send('credit_applications', value=data)
    print("Sent:", data)
    time.sleep(2)

2. *Flink Job (Pseudo)*
Detects fraud in real time.

*Logic*:  
- If `loan_amount > 15000` and `credit_score < 450` → alert  
- Result stored in MongoDB.

*`flink_jobs/fraud_detection.py`*
python
Pseudo-PyFlink
if loan_amount > 15000 and credit_score < 450:
    emit_alert(application_id, reason="Risky transaction")

3. *Spark Job*
Calculates risk scores from Kafka or HDFS and writes to PostgreSQL.

*`processing/spark_jobs/credit_scoring_job.py`*
python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import when

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CreditScoring").getOrCreate()

df = spark.read.json("hdfs://localhost:9000/kafka-data/credit_apps.json")

df = df.withColumn("risk_level", when(df.credit_score >= 700, "Low")
.when(df.credit_score >= 500, "Medium")
.otherwise("High"))

df.write.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/creditdb")\
    .option("dbtable", "credit_scores")\
    .option("user", "postgres")\
    .option("password", "admin")\
    .mode("append").save()

4. *PostgreSQL Setup*

*`storage/postgres_setup.sql`*
sql
CREATE TABLE credit_scores (
    application_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    credit_score INT,
    loan_amount FLOAT,
    risk_level TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE data_quality_issues (
    record_id SERIAL,
    issue TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE metadata_table (
    job TEXT,
    source TEXT,
    target TEXT,

- Access Control: DB roles and service authentication
- Lineage: Metadata tracked in metadata_table
- Policies:
  - Credit score ≥ 600 for low risk
  - Loan amount ≤ $15,000 for instant approval
- Auditing: Logged via Kafka + Spark job logs

✅ Data Quality Control

- Kafka Producer validates ranges:
python
assert 300 <= data["credit_score"] <= 850
assert data["loan_amount"] > 0


- Spark Job:
  - Drops invalid rows
  - Logs issues to data_quality_issues

🧪 How to Run

1. Launch All Services
docker-compose up -d


2. Start Producer
python ingestion/kafka_producer.py


3. Run Spark Job
spark-submit processing/spark_jobs/credit_scoring_job.py


📊 Dashboards
 Power BI connects to PostgreSQL
- Shows:
  - Loan distribution by risk
  - Fraud alerts
  - Approved/rejected rates by region
Grafana monitors:
  - Kafka lag
  - Spark job counts
  - Fraud spikes
    
- *Power BI*: Open `.pbix` file and connect to PostgreSQL  
- *Grafana*: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)  
- *Flink*: http://localhost:8081  
- *Prometheus*: http://localhost:9090

🔐 Data Governance
- Access Control: DB-level credentials & RBAC
- Lineage Tracking: Metadata logged in PostgreSQL
- Audit Logs: Kafka logs + Spark job output
- Policy Management: Thresholds & exceptions tracked in MongoDB + Power BI  


✅ Data Quality Control
- Validation at Ingestion (e.g., credit score range, nulls)
- Spark Cleansing: Invalid records → data_quality_issues table
- Metrics: Dropped records, fraud rates, Kafka lags
- Alerts: Triggered via Grafana thresholds
  
📈 Monitoring
Grafana dashboards visualize system throughput, job status, Kafka topics, and fraud alert volumes. Uses Prometheus to scrape metrics. 

📤 Exporting & Reporting
- Power BI reports can be exported to PDF
- MongoDB alerts exportable via script
- Grafana dashboards sharable as snapshots
